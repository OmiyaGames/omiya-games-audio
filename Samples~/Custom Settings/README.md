# Installing Custom Audio Settings

0. If you haven't done so already, first setup `Addressables`:
    1. Select `Window -> Asset Managerment -> Addressables -> Groups` from the file menu bar.
    2. A pop-up with a single button will appear. Click `Create Addressables Settings`.
    3. After some new assets are created in the project, close the pop-up window.  Addressables are now setup.
1. After importing this sample, select `Edit -> Project Settings...` from the file menu bar.
2. In the Project Settings window, on the left sidebar, select `Omiya Games -> Audio`.
3. Drag-and-drop the `Audio Settings - Custom` file to the first field, `Active Settings`.
4. If you haven't done so already, setup the Saves Settings.
    1. On the left sidebar, select `Omiya Games -> Saves`.
    2. If there's a single object field and `Create...` button, click on `Create...`.  Otherwise, skip to step 5.
    3. Save the new file to any location within the project's `Assets` folder.  This will setup the Saves Settings.
5. Switch back to `Omiya Games -> Audio`, then scroll down and click the `Add Savers To Saves Settings` button.
6. That's all there is to it!  Afterwards, feel free to edit the mixers and the project settings fields to your liking.
