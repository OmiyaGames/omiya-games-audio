# Sound Effect

The `SoundEffect` script interfaces with an audio source to perform common tricks to create more varied sound effects.  It is designed to add features to Unity's built-in `AudioSource` component:

Note that an audio clip doesn't have to be added into the audio source for `SoundEffect` to work: the script will automatically choose a random clip from the clip variations list and set the audio source's clip.  That said, if a clip has been added to the attached audio source, that will be added to the clip variations list on script awake, with a default `Frequency` of one.  Lastly, most adjustments made to the attached audio source -- besides volume and pitch, if `Mutate Volume` and `Mutate Pitch` fields are checked, respectively -- *will* affect the sound played by `SoundEffect`, including all the overlapping sound effects generated by this script.

Using the sound effect script in code is pretty simple:
```csharp
using System.Collections;
using UnityEngine;
using OmiyaGames.Audio;

public class TimeEffectsExample : MonoBehaviour
{
    [SerializeField]
    SoundEffect testSound;

    IEnumerator Start()
    {
        // Setting up audio manager so the sound effect will play at the right volume
        yield return AudioManager.Setup();

        // Play a random clip in the clip variations list
        testSound.Play();
    }
}
```

Also, sound effect can be directly added into the hierarchy via the `Create...` menu, both in the hierarchy window, and right-click context menu.  This method has the added benefit of setting the audio source's output to the mixer group set in the Sound Effects settings under Audio Manager's Project Settings:
